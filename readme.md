# Livonia 1991: Remnants of the Red Star

It is the year 1991, the Soviet Union has fallen and after the Singing Revolution the nation of Livonia is free from occupation once more!

However, the Russian general responsible for the orderly withdrawal of Soviet Forces has gone rogue and is keeping the southern part of the Nadb√≥r region under his personal control, terror reigns this patch of Eastern Europe..

With NATO backing the government of Livonia, the fight for the full liberation of Livonia is on its way! Join the resistance, or collaborate with the occupiers.....


# Intention of the mission
This is the sandbox mission I use on my ARMA3 server for RHS related tomfoolery. It contains a BLUEFOR and an OPFOR base (USA vs Russians).

The idea of the mission is sort of antistasi in nature, but my own spin on it. This is primairly to teach myself how to create missions in ARMA3.

There is plenty of aircraft for flying around and stuff on the ground for target practice, there is also stuff for slingloading like ammo crates and HMMVs!

Suggestions are welcome!

# TODO:

## GENERAL:
- Fix render distance from (apparantly) 250m to max
- Setup a CI/CD pipeline for this mission. (having to manually save and commit every time I finish a task is annoying and not intuitive)
- set up sectors at the bridges to capture and keep control over.
- set up sectors on various towns, settlements and radio towers to control over
- set win condition if either side captures ALL the bridgeheads AND the other ones base
## BLUEFOR:
- more aircraft at bluefor base

## OPFOR:
- Add actual opfor ground targets to shoot at!
