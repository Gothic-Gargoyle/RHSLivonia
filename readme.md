# Livonia 1991: Remnants of the Red Star

It is the year 1991, the Soviet Union has fallen and after the Singing Revolution the nation of Livonia is free from occupation once more!
However, a Russian general responsible for the orderly withdrawal of Soviet Forces has gone rogue and is keeping the southern part of the Nadb√≥r region under his personal control.
With NATO backing the fight for the full liberation of Livonia is on its way! Join the resistance, or collaborate with the invaders.....


# Intention of the mission
This is the sandbox mission I use on my ARMA3 server for RHS related tomfoolery. It contains a BLUEFOR and an OPFOR base (USA vs Russians).

There is plenty of aircraft for flying around and target practice, there is also the possibility of slingloading lots of stuff like ammo crates and HMMVs!

Suggestions are welcome!

# TODO:

## GENERAL:
- Fix render distance from (apparantly) 250m to max
- Setup a CI/CD pipeline for this mission. (having to manually save and commit every time I finish a task is annoying and not intuitive)
- setup sectors at the bridges to capture and keep control over.

## BLUEFOR:
- more aircraft at bluefor base

## OPFOR:
- Add actual opfor ground targets to shoot at!
