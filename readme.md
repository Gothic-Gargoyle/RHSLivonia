# Livonia RHS sandbox mission
This is the sandbox mission I use on my ARMA3 server for RHS related tomfoolery. It contains a BLUEFOR and an OPFOR base (USA vs Russians).

There is plenty of aircraft for flying around and target practice, there is also the possibility of slingloading lots of stuff like ammo crates and HMMVs!

Suggestions are welcome!

# TODO:

## GENERAL:
- Fix render distance from (apparantly) 250m to max
- Setup a CI/CD pipeline for this mission. (having to manually save and commit every time i finish a task is annoying and not intuitive)

## BLUEFOR:
- more aircraft at bluefor base

## OPFOR:
- Add actual opfor ground targets to shoot at!
